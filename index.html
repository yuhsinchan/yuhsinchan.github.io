    <p style = "font-family:georgia;color:white" id = "hi"> Hi, I'm Chan Yu-Hsin, a freshman in NTUEE. I come from Hsinchu,
        where is a windy city, and a desert of tasty food. The high school I studied at is
        <a href = "http://www.hchs.hc.edu.tw/" alt = "National Hsinchu High School"> National Hsinchu High School </a>
        (HCHS). HCHS is a school consisted of boys only. Although there's almost no girls in the school, we still enjoy the life 
        in HCHS. After memorable three years in HCHS, I came to <a href = "https://www.ntu.edu.tw/" alt = "NTU"> National 
        Taiwan University</a> last year and major in <a href = "https://www.ee.ntu.edu.tw/" alt = "NTUEE">
        Electrical Engineering</a>. I join a club, <a href = "https://nturacing.wixsite.com/epsilon1"> NTU racing team</a>. In 
        this club, we are going to bulid a race car to take part in FSAE Japan, a student formula contest, every year. I think 
        it's quite challenging but it's worth spending time on it!

        I have been playing the piano for over ten years. During these years, piano plays an important part in my life. No matter
        I'm happy or sad, piano always be the best thing for me to express my emotion. I used to take part in many piano competition, 
        and I got good results on them. Also, I held a piano recital last year, which is seen as a milestone in my piano career.

        <p style = "background-color:rgb(0, 0, 0, .3);color:white; font-family:calibri;">
        Formula One, also called F1 in short, is an international auto racing sport. F1 is the highest level of single-seat, 
        open-wheel and open-cockpit professional motor racing contest.<br>Formula One racing is governed and sanctioned by a world body called the FIA − Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile or the International 
        Automobile Federation. The name ‘Formula’ comes from the set of rules that the participating cars and drivers must follow. I like to watch car racing, especially formula one. Imaging a car accelerates to over 
        300km/hr, and hard braking to enter a curve, which is super exciting. My favorite team is Mercedes-AMG Petronas F1 team. They have dominated the race for six years, and no one can beat them these years. My 
        favorite driver is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Hamilton" alt="LH44" target="_blank">Lewis Hamilton</a>, one of the GOAT in F1 history. He is going to break Micheal Schumacher's most championship record next year, which will make him great.

        <p style = "background-color:rgb(0, 0, 0, .5);color:white; font-family:calibri;"> 
        I started to play badminton when I was eleven, and it's a pretty interesting sport. I play men's double, because it can let me make 
        good use of my advantages. I can smash the ball brutally, so when the opponent hit the ball high in the air, I will let them know how fast my smash is. However, I move slowly on the court, so I can't 
        play single because it demands quickness and speed. My favorite player is Tai Tsu-ying, the best women's single player in the world. She has fabulous skill, and every time when I watch her game, 
        I can't close my mouth because I can't imagine why a human can let the ball fly in such a wierd route, and the only thing the opponent can do is to see the ball fall on the ground.
